# SDKWork Deploy
repository-kind: foundation-dependency

SDKWork Deploy is the SaaS-capable Deploy Web Server control plane. It manages web
applications, domains, TLS certificates, Nginx-compatible configuration, build and deploy
pipelines, release history, rollback, health checks, and operational audit.

This repository follows `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`. Application identity is declared in `sdkwork.app.config.json`.

## Standards Alignment

| Framework | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `sdkwork-web-framework` | Integrated — auth, route manifests, v3 `SdkWorkApiResponse` / `ProblemDetail` mapping |
| `sdkwork-database` | Integrated through `database/` assets and `sdkwork-deploy-database-host` |
| `sdkwork-utils-rust` | HTTP envelope types, `parse_bool`, `slugify`, `sha256_hash`, pagination helpers |
| `sdkwork-discovery` | Deferred until RPC services are introduced |
| `sdkwork-drive-app-sdk` | Integrated — Drive-backed upload sessions via `sdkwork-deploy-drive-port` |
